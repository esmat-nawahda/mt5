# Independent Position Monitoring Per Pair

## Overview
The MT5 trading bot now implements **independent monitoring per trading pair**. Each pair (XAUUSD, BTCUSD) has its own dedicated monitoring thread and signal tracking, allowing simultaneous positions without blocking.

## Key Changes

### 1. Separate Monitoring Threads
- **Before**: Single global monitoring thread for all positions
- **After**: Individual monitoring thread per symbol
  - `monitoring_threads["XAUUSD"]` - Dedicated thread for XAUUSD
  - `monitoring_threads["BTCUSD"]` - Dedicated thread for BTCUSD

### 2. Independent Signal Tracking
- **Before**: Global signal list `last_analysis_signals = []`
- **After**: Per-symbol signal storage `last_analysis_signals = {}`
  - `last_analysis_signals["XAUUSD"]` - Latest signal for XAUUSD
  - `last_analysis_signals["BTCUSD"]` - Latest signal for BTCUSD

### 3. Per-Symbol Functions

#### `continuous_position_monitor(symbol)`
- Monitors a specific symbol only
- Checks positions every 30 seconds
- Only checks for signal reversals on its assigned pair

#### `start_continuous_monitoring(symbol)`
- Starts monitoring for a specific symbol
- Creates a dedicated thread named `Monitor-{symbol}`
- Won't create duplicate threads if already running

#### `stop_continuous_monitoring(symbol=None)`
- If symbol provided: Stops only that symbol's monitoring
- If no symbol: Stops all monitoring threads
- Clean shutdown with 5-second timeout

#### `analyze_positions_for_reversal(symbol=None)`
- If symbol provided: Analyzes only that symbol
- If no symbol: Analyzes all open positions

### 4. Auto-Refresh Enhancement
- `auto_refresh_open_trades()` now shows which symbols are being checked
- Only checks positions for the symbols with new signals
- More efficient and clearer logging

## Benefits

### 1. True Independence
- XAUUSD position doesn't block BTCUSD trading
- BTCUSD position doesn't block XAUUSD trading
- Each pair operates completely independently

### 2. Better Resource Management
- Only monitors pairs with open positions
- Threads start when positions open
- Threads can stop when positions close

### 3. Clearer Monitoring
- Logs show `[XAUUSD]` or `[BTCUSD]` for clarity
- Each pair's monitoring is tracked separately
- Easy to see which pair triggered actions

### 4. Scalability
- Easy to add more pairs in the future
- Each new pair gets its own thread
- No global bottlenecks

## How It Works

### Opening Positions
1. Bot analyzes XAUUSD → Opens position → Starts XAUUSD monitoring
2. Bot analyzes BTCUSD → Opens position → Starts BTCUSD monitoring
3. Both monitoring threads run independently every 30 seconds

### Signal Reversal Checks
- XAUUSD thread checks only XAUUSD positions against XAUUSD signals
- BTCUSD thread checks only BTCUSD positions against BTCUSD signals
- No cross-interference between pairs

### Position Management
- Maximum 1 position per pair (unchanged)
- Maximum 2 total positions (unchanged)
- But now truly independent operation

## Example Flow

```
Time 10:00:00
- Analyze XAUUSD → BUY signal → Open position
- Start monitoring thread for XAUUSD

Time 10:00:30
- [XAUUSD Monitor] Check for reversal → Position maintained

Time 10:01:00
- Analyze BTCUSD → SELL signal → Open position
- Start monitoring thread for BTCUSD

Time 10:01:30
- [XAUUSD Monitor] Check for reversal → Position maintained
- [BTCUSD Monitor] Check for reversal → Position maintained

Time 10:02:00
- [XAUUSD Monitor] Signal reversed → Close XAUUSD position
- [BTCUSD Monitor] Position maintained
- XAUUSD slot now available for new trades
```

## Configuration
No configuration changes needed. The system automatically:
- Creates monitoring threads as needed
- Manages thread lifecycle
- Cleans up on shutdown

## Testing
The implementation includes comprehensive testing:
- Thread creation per symbol
- Independent thread operation
- Signal storage per symbol
- Selective thread stopping
- Clean shutdown procedures

All tests pass successfully, confirming independent operation.
