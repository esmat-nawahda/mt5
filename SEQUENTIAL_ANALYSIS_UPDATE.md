# Sequential Analysis Update

## Overview
The MT5 trading bot has been modified to analyze pairs **sequentially** instead of in parallel. This means the bot now:
1. Analyzes one pair at a time
2. Makes a trading decision immediately after each analysis
3. Can open a position before analyzing the next pair

## Previous Behavior (Parallel)
- Analyzed both XAUUSD and BTCUSD completely
- Collected all signals
- Sorted by confidence
- Then decided which trades to execute

## New Behavior (Sequential)
- Analyzes XAUUSD first
- Makes trading decision for XAUUSD
- If position opened, continues to BTCUSD
- If max positions reached, stops analysis
- Each pair gets independent, immediate decision

## Key Changes

### 1. Analysis Loop Structure
```python
# OLD: Analyze all, then decide
for symbol in PAIRS:
    # Analyze and collect signals
signals = sorted(signals)
for sig in signals:
    # Make decisions

# NEW: Analyze and decide one by one
for symbol in PAIRS:
    # Analyze
    # Display results
    # Make immediate decision
    # Execute trade if appropriate
    # Continue or stop based on position count
```

### 2. Decision Points
- **Immediate Decision**: After analyzing each pair, the bot immediately decides whether to trade
- **Early Exit**: If maximum positions are reached, the bot stops analyzing remaining pairs
- **Position Check**: Before analyzing each pair, checks if positions are still available

### 3. Display Flow
The bot now shows:
1. "PERFORMING SEQUENTIAL MARKET ANALYSIS"
2. For each pair:
   - Technical analysis
   - AI analysis results
   - Confidence breakdown
   - Guardian filters
   - **DECISION TIME FOR [SYMBOL]**
   - Trade execution or skip reason
3. "SEQUENTIAL ANALYSIS COMPLETE" summary

## Benefits

### 1. Faster Execution
- No need to wait for all pairs to be analyzed
- Can open position on first good signal

### 2. Resource Efficiency
- Stops analyzing if max positions reached
- Reduces unnecessary API calls

### 3. Clearer Logic
- Each pair gets independent treatment
- Decision flow is more transparent
- Easier to understand why trades were taken

## Configuration
No configuration changes needed. The bot still respects:
- `max_concurrent_trades`: 2 (maximum positions)
- One position per pair maximum
- All existing risk management rules

## Testing
The implementation has been tested for:
- Syntax validity
- Proper sequential flow
- Position counting
- Early exit on max positions
- Continuous monitoring integration

## Monitoring
The continuous monitoring system remains unchanged:
- Still checks positions every 30 seconds
- Still closes on signal reversals
- Still updates stop losses as configured
